            My portfolio showcases a simple and effective Python script that
            keeps you informed about the latest stock market news and price
            changes for Tesla Inc (TSLA). Using the Alpha Vantage API, the
            script fetches daily adjusted stock prices and calculates the
            percentage change in price between the most recent two trading
            days.With the News API, the script also gathers the top three news
            articles related to Tesla Inc. If the price change exceeds 1%, the
            script generates an SMS notification using the Twilio API, which
            includes the percentage change, an emoji indicating the direction of
            change (ðŸ”º for increase, ðŸ”» for decrease), as well as the headlines
            and brief descriptions of the top news articles.This project
            demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming and API
            integration, along with my ability to process financial data and
            work with external APIs.

            This project epitomizes the integration of technology and heartfelt
            gestures by automating personalized birthday wishes through the
            power of Python programming. The project starts by leveraging the
            pandas library to efficiently read and manage birthday data from a
            CSV file, which contains meticulously curated information, including
            names, email addresses, and birthdates.With precision and accuracy,
            the script then identifies birthdays occurring on the current day,
            ensuring no special occasion goes unnoticed. Once a birthday is
            detected, the script delves into the realm of creativity by
            selecting from a pool of three thoughtfully crafted letter
            templates.Each template is carefully designed to imbue a sense of
            warmth and genuine appreciation, guaranteeing a memorable experience
            for the recipient. The inclusion of your name as the sender enhances
            the personal touch, fostering meaningful connections with those who
            matter most.Ensuring utmost security and authentication, the script
            interacts seamlessly with Gmail's SMTP server, utilizing your Gmail
            credentials (email and password) to send the heartwarming
            greetings.The "Automated Birthday Greetings with Gmail" project
            serves as a testament to my prowess in Python programming,
            proficiency in data handling with pandas, and adeptness in
            integrating external services to deliver seamless automated
            solutions.

          <p>
            Powered by the OpenWeather API, this project enables the retrieval
            of real-time weather data based on specific geographical
            coordinates, enhancing accuracy and relevance. To access the weather
            information seamlessly, the script requires an API key that can be
            easily integrated for personalized use.The core functionality of the
            "Rain Alert System" revolves around scheduled checks for potential
            rainy conditions. Utilizing the schedule library, the script
            periodically executes weather checks at fixed intervals, ensuring
            you receive up-to-date notifications without any manual
            intervention.When the script detects a high likelihood of rain
            (identified by specific weather condition codes), it efficiently
            communicates the alert to you via SMS. The incorporation of Twilio's
            API guarantees secure and reliable message delivery, utilizing your
            Twilio account credentials for authentication.Through this project,
            I demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, API integration,
            and effective automation strategies.

            a series of segments, navigates a colorful game arena in pursuit of
            delectable food items.The rules are simple: guide the Snake using
            the arrow keys, directing it to consume the enticing food placed
            randomly across the screen. As the Snake devours the food, it grows
            longer, presenting both challenges and opportunities for strategic
            maneuvering.The Snake's goal is to collect as much food as possible
            while avoiding collision with the walls or its own body. With each
            successful meal, the player's score increases, providing a sense of
            accomplishment and encouragement to keep playing.
